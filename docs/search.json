Growing up I loved\nmath and science, so when I had the chance I decided to pursue those\nsubjects in university. For my BSc (Joint Hons) in Applied Math and\nPhysics, I completed research in numerical methods for adaptive mesh\ngeneration. This research was conducted under the supervision of\nDr. Ronald Haynes. Next, I completed my MSc in Math under the\nsupervision of Dr. Hari Kunduri. This research focused on theoretical\nblack holes and their geometry. My BEd in Intermediate/Secondary\nEducation was completed as I finished my MSc. This included a teaching\ninternship at Prince of Wales Collegiate in St. John’s, NL.\n\n\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy spending time outside. This includes\nrelaxing beach trips or day long hiking expeditions. Growing up in\nNewfoundland gives one ample opportunity to explore nature and I’m lucky\nto continue doing so on beautiful Prince Edward Island. I live in\nCharlottetown with my wife and our five pets (2 dogs and 3 cats).\n\n\n\n",
